## Installation

We provide three options for installing Spine Toolbox. The first two options also require that you **follow 
the Pre-installation steps**: 
- [Python/pipx](#installation-with-python-and-pipx) (we intend to make stable releases every month or so)
- [From source files](#installation-from-sources-using-git) (this is the cutting edge - and more likely to have bugs)
- [Windows installation package](#windows-64-bit-installer-package) (these are quite old - not recommended)

### Pre-installation

These steps apply to both [Python/pipx](#installation-with-python-and-pipx) option and to 
[From source files](#installation-from-sources-using-git) option.

1. If you don't have Python installed, please install e.g. **Python 3.11** from 
[Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3117/).

2. Test that python is now in your PATH. Open a new terminal (e.g. Command Prompt) window and type 

       python --version

    The output should be the Python version. If it did not work (e.g. the output is *'python' command not found* or 
similar or the [Microsoft Store opens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/faqs#why-does-running-python-exe-open-the-microsoft-store-)),
you need to add the Python installation folder into the PATH environment variable. On Windows, this can be done 
from Windows Control Panel (use search with 'environment').
[See specific instructions for all operating systems from this link](https://realpython.com/add-python-to-path/).

3. Install Git. Windows version can be found here: https://git-scm.com/download/win.

4. Test that Git is now in your PATH. Open a new terminal after installing Git and type

       git --version

    If the output from this command is not the Git version, you need to add  `<git-install-path>/Git/cmd` into 
your PATH environment variable.

5. Upgrade `pip` to the latest version (pip is a package manager for Python)

       python -m pip install --upgrade pip

### Installation with Python and pipx

This works best for users that just want to use Spine Toolbox and keep it updated 
with new releases.

Once you have completed the [Pre-installation](#pre-installation) steps, do the following:

1. Install [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/). pipx helps in creating an isolated environment for Spine 
Toolbox to avoid package conflicts. Open a terminal and run

        python -m pip install --user pipx

    After pipx has been installed, run

        python -m pipx ensurepath

2. **Restart the terminal** or re-login for the changes of the latest command to take effect.

3. Choose which Spine Toolbox version to install. Latest *release* version from PyPi is installed using 

        python -m pipx install spinetoolbox

   or the latest *development* version using

        python -m pipx install git+https://github.com/spine-tools/spinetoolbox-dev

That’s it! To launch Spine Toolbox, open a terminal and run

    spinetoolbox

If for some reason the command is not found, the executable can be found under `~/.local/bin` 
(`%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` on Windows).

To upgrade Spine Toolbox to the latest *release*, open a terminal and run

    python -m pipx upgrade spinetoolbox

or upgrade the *development* version with

    python -m pipx upgrade spinetoolbox-dev


### Installation from sources using Git

This option is for developers and other contributors who want to debug or edit Spine Toolbox source code. Once 
you have completed the [Pre-installation](#pre-installation) steps, do the following:

1. Clone this repository. Open a terminal, use the `cd` command to change the current directory to some data 
directory (preferably not a OneDrive folder on Windows), and run

       git clone https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox.git

    This creates a `Spine-Toolbox` directory into your current directory.

2. Use the `cd` command to go to `Spine-Toolbox` dir

       cd ./Spine-Toolbox

3. Create a Python virtual environment using

        python -m venv .venv

    This creates a `.venv` directory into the `Spine-Toolbox` directory, but you can create the virtual environment 
anywhere on your system. <br><br>

    Optional: Instead of venv, one can also use a
[miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/glossary.html#miniconda-glossary) environment. 
You can [download miniconda from here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). **Note: Anaconda 
environments are not supported.** Create a new Python 3.11 miniconda environment without linking packages from the 
base environment using

        conda create -n spinetoolbox python=3.11

4. Activate the venv environment on Windows (provided that you are in `Spine-Toolbox` directory) using

       cd ./.venv/Scripts
       activate

    Or on bash, zsh 

       source .venv/bin/activate

    or on a Conda prompt (if you are using a miniconda environment instead of venv)

       conda activate spinetoolbox 

    **Make sure that the terminal prompt now indicates the active environment.**

5. Use the `cd ..` command to go back to the `Spine-Toolbox` directory (the one that 
contains `requirements.txt`) if needed.

6. Install Spine Toolbox along with its dependencies with

        python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    
7. (Optional) Install additional development packages with

        python -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

8. Once the installation has finished, you can now launch Spine Toolbox using

       spinetoolbox

**To upgrade**, pull the latest changes from the Spine Toolbox repository (while in `Spine-Toolbox` directory)

    git pull
    git fetch --tags origin

and run (to upgrade the other Spine Toolbox packages)

    python -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt

**NOTE:** The version number of Spine packages are automatically
generated from Git tags during the `python -m pip install ...` step. 
This makes it important to fetch new tags from GitHub before running the 
`python -m pip install ...` when upgrading. This is true also for editable 
installations.

#### Additional comments for developers

If you are alternating between multiple branches, you should repeat
the `pip install -e .` step after switching a branch.  This ensures
the version number is updated correctly.  On the other hand if you do
not need the version number to be precise, it is okay to skip the
step.

To illustrate with an example, consider there are two feature branches
`P` and `Q` that you are working on. Both are based on `master` after
the release `0.6.18`.

```
 0.6.18
---o----o--o--o  P
    \
     o--o--o--o  Q
```

Then the versions are:
- `P`: `0.7.0.dev3+g<commit-hash-P>.d<commit-date-P>`,
- `Q`: `0.7.0.dev4+g<commit-hash-Q>.d<commit-date-Q>`.

The version should be available inside Python as:
```python
from spinetoolbox.version import version_tuple

print(version_tuple)
# P: (0, 7, 0, 'dev3', 'g<commit-hash-P>.d<commit-date-P>')
# Q: (0, 7, 0, 'dev4', 'g<commit-hash-Q>.d<commit-date-Q>')
```

So if your code uses any of the components of the `version_tuple` that
might change, you should re-run `pip install`, otherwise this can be 
ignored safely.

### Windows 64-bit installer package

There are old Windows installer packages available for a quick install, but they are
at this point (26.1.2023) quite obsolete and cannot be recommended for anything but 
a quick look at how Spine Toolbox looks and feels (although even that has changed).
Download the installer package from 
[here](https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox/releases),
run it, and follow the instructions to install Spine Toolbox.

### About requirements

Python 3.8.1-3.11 is required. Python 3.8.0 is not supported due to problems in DLL loading on Windows.

See the files `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` for packages required to run Spine Toolbox.
(Additional packages needed for development are listed in `dev-requirements.txt`.)

The requirements include three packages ([`spinedb_api`](https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Database-API),
[`spine_engine`](https://github.com/spine-tools/spine-engine), and 
[`spine_items`](https://github.com/spine-tools/spine-items)), developed by the Spine project consortium.

### Building the User Guide

You can find the latest documentation on [readthedocs](https://spine-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
If you want to build the documentation yourself,
source files for the User Guide can be found in `docs/source` directory. In order to 
build the HTML docs, you need to install the *optional requirements* (see section 
'Installing requirements' above). This installs Sphinx (among other things), which 
is required in building the documentation. When Sphinx is installed, you can build the 
HTML pages from the user guide source files by using the `bin/build_doc.bat` script on 
Windows or the `bin/build_doc.sh` script on Linux and Mac. After running the script, the 
index page can be found in `docs/build/html/index.html`. The User Guide can also 
be opened from Spine Toolbox menu Help->User Guide (F2).

### Troubleshooting

#### Obscure crashes that may produce a traceback related to PySide6's model classes

The first thing is to make sure that you are not using Anaconda. Only Miniconda is supported. Anaconda's base 
environment includes Qt related packages and we suspect that they leak some shared Qt libraries into environments,
even when specifically requesting that base environment packages should not be linked to environment packages. See
also [Problems in starting the application](#problems-in-starting-the-application) below.

#### Installation fails

Please make sure you are using Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11 to install the requirements.

#### 'No Python' error when installing with pipx

If you see the following error when running the command `python -m pipx install spinetoolbox`

```
No Python at 'c:\python38\python.exe'
Fatal error from pip prevented installation. Full pip output in file:
```

Where c:\python38\python.exe may be some other path. To fix this, delete the folder 
`C:\Users\<user name>\.local\pipx\shared` and run the `python -m pipx install spinetoolbox` command again.

#### Installation fails on Linux
If Python runs into errors while installing on Linux systems, running the 
following command in a terminal may help:

```shell
$ sudo apt install libpq-dev
```

#### Problems in starting the application

If there are problems in starting Spine Toolbox, the chances are that the required 
packages were not installed successfully. In case this happens, the first thing you 
should check is that you don't have `Qt`, `PyQt4`, `PyQt5`, `PySide`, `PySide2`, and 
`PySide6` packages installed in the same environment. These do not play nice together 
and may introduce conflicts. In addition, make sure that you do not have multiple versions 
of these `Qt` related packages installed in the same environment. The easiest way 
to solve this problem is to create a blank (e.g. venv virtual environment) Python 
environment just for `PySide6` applications and installing the requirements again.

**Warning: Using the *conda-forge* channel for installing the requirements is not 
recommended.**

The required `qtconsole` package from the ***conda-forge*** channel also
installs `qt` and `PyQt` packages. Since this is a `PySide6` application, those 
are not needed and there is a chance of conflicts between the packages.

**Note**: Python 3.8.0 is not supported. Use Python 3.8.1 or later.

### SpineOpt: A flexible energy system modelling framework in Julia
*Tuesday Sep 7, 14:00-15:30 CEST (8:00-9:30 EDT) - Organized together with EERA ESI*

The importance of operational details in planning future energy systems has been rapidly increasing. One driver for this is the increasing role of variable power generation, which requires that the energy system models consider higher temporal granularity, longer time series and new aspects in power system stability. Another important driver is a consequence of sector coupling through the electrification of transport, space heating and industries. As the other sectors become more integrated with electricity, they need to be modelled at a granularity that is sufficient for describing the potential flexibility they can bring to the power system dominated by variable and uncertain power generation.

This webinar will present the open source Julia based energy system modelling framework SpineOpt, which has been built with these challenges in mind. It can represent different energy sectors using representation typically available only in sector specific models and with highly adaptable temporal and stochastic structures available both for planning and operations.

### Demonstration of Spine modelling tools through selected case studies
*Thursday Sep 9, 14:00-16:00 CEST (8:00-10:00 EDT)*

[Full recording](https://youtu.be/i2fxDwsMuF8), all presentations slides [PDF](http://www.spine-model.org/pdf/webinar/Case_Studies_all_presentations.pdf)

Over the past 4 years, the EU project Spine has developed a set of open-source tools for modelling complex energy systems. This webinar demonstrates the Spine software through six selected case studies, covering topics such as sector coupling, co-optimization of operation and investments, stochastic modelling, and rolling horizon optimization. Each subsection described below consists of a brief introduction followed by a live demonstration of the particular case, where some of the outstanding features of Spine are highlighted and discussed.

Recording Chapters:
- [00:05-00:15](https://youtu.be/i2fxDwsMuF8?t=252) Introduction to Spine: This section uses a simple example to demonstrate the SpineOpt modelling principle. First, the user defines the different objects in their system, such as units and nodes, as well as the relationships between them, such as which units are connected to which nodes. Then, they specify values for certain pre-defined parameters such as node demand, unit capacity, cost, and conversion ratio. The resulting dataset is passed to SpineOpt which generates the corresponding optimisation model, optimizes it, and delivers the results.
- [00:15-00:30](https://youtu.be/i2fxDwsMuF8?t=939) Hydro: This section demonstrates hydropower modelling in Spine as performed in Case study A5. The objective is to model part of the Swedish hydropower system, namely the Skellefte river with its 15 power stations, by coupling the river system with the power system. The model maximizes income from electricity supply over one week with an hourly resolution, while respecting basic hydrological constraints.
- [00:29-00:45](https://youtu.be/i2fxDwsMuF8?t=1745) Building heating: This section demonstrates building heating modelling in Spine as performed in Case study A4. The objective is to model the Finnish power and district heating system coupled with an electrically heated residential building stock. The result is a rolling unit commitment and economic dispatch model, that optimizes system performance over one year at hourly resolution.  
- [00:45-00:57] Break
- [00:57-01:06](https://youtu.be/i2fxDwsMuF8?t=3411) Gas grid: This section demonstrates gas grid modelling in Spine as performed in Case study A2. The objective is to model a natural gas transmission system with pressure-driven gas and couple it with an electricity system to capture the flexibility provided by the gas network. The result is a dispatch model that co-optimizes operations in both systems over a day at hourly resolution.
- [01:06-01:22](https://youtu.be/i2fxDwsMuF8?t=3992) Stochastic: This section demonstrates stochastic modelling in Spine using a simple example system. Three different stochastic structures are demonstrated: purely deterministic, stochastic fan, and converging fan.
- [01:22-01:35](https://youtu.be/i2fxDwsMuF8?t=4970) Power grid investments: This section demonstrates power grid investment modelling in Spine as performed in case study C2. The objective is twofold: (i) to model the Nordic synchronous power system (Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark) with high operational detail; and (ii) to find optimal transmission line investment decisions over a long-term horizon of 10 years, for three different wind penetration scenarios.

### SpineInterface: How to quickly and easily create new optimization models in Julia Friday
*Friday Sep 10, 14:00-15:30 CEST (8:00-9:30 EDT)*

[Full recording](https://youtu.be/cUopRUTzXpY), all presentations [PDF](http://www.spine-model.org/pdf/webinar/SpineInterface_all_presentations.pdf)

Creation of new optimisation models requires a lot of work to get the data to the models and the results out of the models. Spine Toolbox is an open source data and workflow management tool to assist with these tasks and can work with models written in any language. Meanwhile, SpineInterface is a Julia package that links the data management capabilities of Spine Toolbox with Julia/JuMP modelling environment in a very direct way.

The data interfaces of Spine Toolbox together with SpineInterface simplifies the process of developing optimization models by allowing the model developer to focus on the constraint equations. The required data structures and data are defined with a graphical interface in Spine Toolbox and are immediately available to the model developer inside the constraint equation code without any action or code required by the model developer. SpineInterface supports the full range of data parameter types supported by Toolbox and provides a mechanism for representation of time and time-based data, either time series, time patterns or arbitrarily varying temporal data.

This session will be of interest to model developers and/or students who want a significant head start in developing optimization models. The sessions will also be of interest to model developers who may wish to translate existing models developed in other platforms such as GAMS, into the Spine framework using SpineInterface. The power of SpineInterface will be demonstrated in an interactive session where the full modelling workflow will be illustrated from data structure design and implementation to constraint equation development.

Agenda:
- Overview of SpineInterface
- Toolbox concepts and data structures including the Spine data API
- SpineInterface: convenience functions and accessing Spine Toolbox data in Julia
- Defining a model data structure in Spine Toolbox
- Building and solving an optimization model using SpineInterface
- Q&A + live demo [00:45-01:21](https://youtu.be/cUopRUTzXpY?t=2737)
