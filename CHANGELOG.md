# Changelog
All **notable** changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New context menu action (Select superclass) for entity class items in the entity tree.
- Added buttons to Settings->Tools widget and to Tool Specification Editor for restoring default 
  (defined in Settings->Tools) execution settings.
- Added Tool Specification type (Python, Gams, etc.) icons on Design View.

### Changed

#### Spine data structure

Many parts of the Spine data structure have been redesigned.

- *Entities* have replaced objects and relationships.
  Zero-dimensional entities correspond to objects while multidimensional entities replace the former relationships.
  Unlike relationships, the *elements* of multidimensional entities can now be other multidimensional entities.
- Simple inheritance is now supported by *superclasses*.
- Tools, features and methods have been removed.
  The functionality that was previously implemented using the is_active parameter
  has been replaced by *entity alternatives*.
  Entity classes have a default setting for the entity alternative called *active by default*.

#### Miscellaneous changes

- Julia execution settings are now Tool specification settings instead of global application settings. You can 
  select a different Julia executable & project or Julia kernel for each Tool spec.
- Headless mode now supports remote execution (see 'python -m spinetoolbox --help')

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

### Security

## [0.7.2] - 2023-12-04

### Added

- Data Connection items now support schemas in database references
- Importer Specification Editor now supports database schemas

## [0.7.1] - 2023-10-06

### Added

- Allow choosing of highlight color for items found in entity graph

### Fixed

- Fixed issues when remote databases were used as references in Data Connections
- Fixed a bug where the order of scenario alternatives would be messed up when copy-pasting
  the alternatives in the Scenario Tree
- Fixed a bug with time series plots
- Fixed issues with Pivot table


## [0.7.0] - 2023-08-25

### Added
- Support for version 11 Spine Toolbox projects.
- Executable Tool Specifications can be used to run any (shell) command. This enhancement
  duplicates the functionality of Gimlet project items and makes them obsolete.
- There is now an option to select if new scenarios or tools are automatically used
  for filtering in Link properties.
- The new "Filer validation" button in Link properties allows forcing at least one scenario or tool
  filter to be checked.
- Python 3.11 support.
- PySide6 support. The app has been ported from PySide2 to PySide6.
- In addition to dragging and dropping, 
  it is now possible to copy alternatives from Alternative tree and paste them to the scenario tree
  in Database editor.
- Scenarios can now be copied and pasted between databases in Database editor.
- Scenarios can now be duplicated in Database editor.
- Tool project item's Python and Julia consoles can now be killed from the right-click context menu.
  A killed console can be restored by restarting it.
- A new option "Kill consoles at the end of execution" has been added to Tool properties,
  that kills Python and Julia console processes after execution saving some memory and computing resources.
- A new option "Log process output to a file" has been added to Tool properties,
  that logs all the 'console' output of the Tool to a file in the logs subfolder.
- You can now open a 'Detached' Jupyter Console on any kernel you have installed in your system from the *Consoles*
  main window menu.
- "Make Julia Kernel" and "Make Python Kernel" buttons in Settings->Tools page. Clicking them creates a new 
  Julia or Python kernel based on selected Julia/Python executable on the same page if the kernel does not exist. 
  If the kernel already exists, it is selected automatically.
- ``project.json`` now has an experimental option ["project"]["settings"]["enable_execute_all"] which disables the
  Execute Project button when set to ``false``. The option is currently not settable in the UI.
- New context menu action (Find...) to find items by name in DB editor's entity graph.

### Changed
- The console settings of Python tools as well as the command and shell settings of executable tools
  are now treated as project-specific data
  and stored in ``<project root>/.spinetoolbox/local/specification_local_data.json``.
  This should make it easier to share projects over e.g. Git.
- Scenario and tool filters are now ON by default.
  If new scenario or tool is added to a database it will be automatically selected in outgoing connections.
  NOTE: In existing projects, if a connection did not have any scenarios/tools selected,
  they will all be selected when opening a project for the first time after this change.
  If this is not desired, the scenarios/tools need to be deselected manually
  before saving the project on disk.
- Project name is now the project directory name and cannot be changed unless by moving the project to another 
  directory manually or by using the File -> Save project as... menu item.
- Scenario filters now filter unrelated scenarios and alternatives as well.
- Alternative/Scenario tree in Database editor has been split into separate Alternative tree and Scenario tree docks.
  This will hopefully make dragging and dropping alternatives to scenarios easier.
- Logic of executing selected project items. URL's passed by unselected Data Transformers are not included automatically 
  into selective execution anymore. When selecting project items for execution, make sure to select also preceding 
  Data Transformers if needed.
- Names for duplicate items/scenarios/etc now use the format `prefix (xx)` instead of `prefix xx`.
  Duplicating a previously duplicated item now has the number `xx` incremented instead of having a new number appended.
- "Open kernel spec editor" buttons in Settings->Tools page have been changed "Make Julia kernel" and 
  "Make Python Kernel" buttons
- 

### Deprecated

- The possibility to export parameter values when exporting object groups using Exporter.
  Existing mappings will not export group parameters anymore.
  Please add explicit parameter export mappings if needed.
- Execute in work setting in Tool Specification Editor. Please use Execute in work setting 
  in Tool Properties instead.
- Kernel Spec Editor widget and the "Open Kernel Spec Editor" button in Tool Specification Editor

### Fixed

## [0.5.0-final.0] - 2020-12-14

### Added
- Exporting graphs as PDF files from the *Graph* menu in the Data Store form.
- Pruning entire classes from the graph view. The option is available both from the *Graph* menu and
  from *Entity Graph* context menus. Also, pruned items can be restored gradually.
- A new Input type *Indexed parameter expansion* is now available in Data Store view's Pivot table.
  In this Input type the indexes, e.g. time stamps of time series get expanded as a new dimension in the table.
- Import editor now has a new Source type: Table name. It can be used e.g. to pick an Excel sheet's
  or GAMS domain's name as the object class name.
- Import editor now supports multidimensional maps. The number of dimensions can be set using the 
  *Map dimensions* spin box in mappings options.
- Executing a project from the command line without opening the Toolbox GUI (i.e. headless execution).
  The headless execution is enabled by the new command line option ``--execute-only``.
- Toolbox now supports scenarios and alternatives. They can be accessed via Data store view's new Alternative tree.

  Console without leaving Spine Toolbox. Kernel (spec) Editor can be found in Settings->Tools tab.
- [win-x64] Includes Tools/python.exe for running Python Tools for systems that do not have a Python installation.
  Also, pyvenv.cfg and path.pth files for configuring the included python.exe.

### Fixed
- Signal disconnection issue in Graph View
- Bugs in removing objects and object classes in Spine db editor's Graph View

### Changed
- Data Store Form is now called 'Spine database editor'
- Spine db editor Graph View behavior. Now selecting objects in the object tree not only shows those objects but also 
  all the cascading relationships. One can still go back to the previous behavior in Settings.
- Moving object items in the graph view also causes relationship icons to follow. This behavior can be disabled in the
  Settings.
- Required PySide2 version is now 5.14. The version is checked at startup.
- Indexed parameter handling has been overhauled in Exporter allowing parameters to share indexing domains.
  **Note**: Due to numerous changes in the backend, Exporters in old project files will not load properly
  and need to be re-configured.
- The way Exporter handles missing parameter values and None values has changed. The item now ignores missing
  values instead of replacing them by the default value. Further, there is a new option to replace None values by
  the default value and another option to replace Nones by not-a-numbers or skip exporting them.
- The numerical indicator on the upper left corner of project items no longer indicates the execution order for
  each individual item because the exact order is not know before the Execute button is actually clicked.
  The number still indicates the execution order but may show the same numbers for items in different parallel
  branches.
- Project.json file format has been upgraded to version 2. Version 1 project.json files are upgraded to version 2
  automatically when a project is opened.
- Default Python interpreter is now {sys.executable} i.e. the one that was used in launching the app.
  This affects the Python used by Python Tool specifications and the PyCall used by SpineOpt.jl configuration 
  assistant.
- [win-x64] Default Python interpreter is the Python in user's PATH if available. If Python is not defined in
  user's PATH, the default Python interpreter is the <app_install_dir>/Tools/python.exe.
- User's now need to explicitly choose the kernel specs for the Python Console and the Julia Console. They are 
  not chosen (nor created) automatically anymore. The kernel specs can be selected in the drop-down menus 
  in application Settings->Tools.
- Database revision handling has been improved. Id est, the app does not offer to upgrade databases 
  that are more recent than the current version of Spine Toolbox can handle.
- Links to User Guide and Getting Started documents open only the online versions. The docs have been 
  published on readthedocs.org.
- Clearing the line edits for Julia executable and Python Interpreter (in Settings->Tools) shows
  the full paths to their respective files as placeholder text.

### Deprecated
- CustomQtKernelManager class

### Removed
- python_repl_widget.py
- julia_repl_widget.py

## [0.4.0-final.0] - 2020-04-03

### Added

  multi-selection or single selection in the Graph view Object tree when selecting items with 
  the **left-mouse button**.
- Projects can be saved to any directory
- Project name can be changed in Settings
- The graph view features a short live demonstration that new users can follow to discover 
  the basic functionality.
- New Setting: *Curved links*. When active, links on the Design View follow a smooth curve 
  rather than a straight line.
- When execution traverses a link, a small animation is played to denote the flow of data. 
  Users can set how quick they want this animation to be in Settings. The fastest setting 
  effectively disables the animation.
- Special 'tag' command line arguments are now available in Tool Specification which expand 
  to, for example, input database URLS or paths to optional input files when a Tool is executed.
- It is now possible to undo/redo database changes in the Data Store form.
- It is now possible to visualize the history of database changes in the Data Store form. The 
  option is available in the Session menu.
- Support for Tool command line arguments. You can now give Tool (project item) command line 
  arguments in addition to Tool Specification command line arguments.
- Undo/Redo in Design View
- It is now possible to add new plots to existing plot windows in Data Store View.
- Objects in Data Store's Tree View are sorted alphabetically
- A new parameter value type, *map* has been added. There is now a dedicated editor to 
  modify maps. Plotting of non-nested maps is supported, as well.
- [win-x64] importer_program.py has been built as an independent application. This program is 
  now distributed with the Spine Toolbox single-file installer. When installing Spine Toolbox,
  the Importer Program app can be found in the Spine Toolbox install directory 
  (/importer_program).
- Import preview window now supports copy-pasting mappings and options from a source table to 
  another
- Import preview window header context-menus for the preview table which, allows users to 
  change all data types at once.
- Provide data for EditRole for nicer editor experience in MappingSpecModel.
- Red background is displayed for invalid values in MappingSpecModel
- Object tooltips now show the descriptions Data Store view's

### Fixed
- Data advertised by a project item during execution is only accessible by its direct 
  successors. In other words, resources are passed to the next items in line but not beyond.
- [win-x64] Executing the Importer project item has been fixed on Windows release version
- Bug fixes for Data Store View
  - Disappearing object names in entity graph
  - Spine db manager error dialogs

- [win-x64] Setting up Python Console. Installing ipykernel and kernel specs now works.
- [win-x64] Setting up Julia Console. Installing IJulia and kernel specs now works.
- Column indexing in Import Editor. When entering a time or time pattern index column 
  manually in Import Editor's lower right corner table, the colors in the preview table 
  failed to update. This should fix the bug and allow column selection both by column index 
  or column header text.

### Changed
- spinetoolbox is now a Python package. To start the app, use command 
  `python -m spinetoolbox` or `python spinetoolbox.py` as spinetoolbox.py has been moved to 
  repository root. 
- Tool templates are now called Tool specifications
- File->Open Project opens a file dialog, where you can open projects by selecting an old 
  <project_name>.proj file or a Spine Toolbox Project directory. Valid Spine Toolbox projects 
  are decorated with the Spine logo.
- Old style projects (.proj files) cannot be opened anymore. The old style projects need to 
  be upgraded before opening. You can upgrade your .proj file projects into new ones with 
  *Project Upgrade Wizard* found in `File->Upgrade project` menu item.
- Project information is not saved to a <project_name>.proj file anymore. This information 
  is now located in file <project_dir>/.spinetoolbox/project.json. Every Spine Toolbox project 
  has this file.
- Work directory is now a global setting instead of a project setting
- Renamed *Data Interface* project item to *Importer*. The corresponding category 
  *Data Importers* was renamed to *Importers*.
- Tree, graph, and tabular views have been merged into one consolidated view. You can choose 
  your preferred style from the Data Store View's `View` menu.
- The graph view behavior has changed. Now selecting objects in the object tree not only 
  shows those objects but also all the cascading relationships. This is to facilitate exploring 
  the system without a previous knowledge.
- importer_program.py now uses the Python interpreter that the app was started with and not 
  the one that is given by user in Settings -> Tools.
- Importer now uses QProcessExecutionManager for running the importer_program.py

### Removed

### Added
- Advanced copy/pasting and multiple selection support for the data store tree view.
- Import data from Excel files into the data store tree view.
- Export Spine database from the data store tree view into an Excel file.
- Save at exit prompt.
- Import data from datapackage into the data store tree view.
- Restore Dock Widgets in the main window.

- Parameter and parameter values are added and edited directly in the data store tree view,
  without need for an additional dialog.
- On-the-fly creation of necessary relationships when entering parameters in data store tree view.
- View item feature for visualizing networks from a Spine database. A view item can visualize databases
  from all data store items connected to it.
- Packages numpy, scipy, and matplotlib are now mandatory requirements.
- Drag files between data connections. File items can be dragged from the references and data lists.
  Data connection items can be selected by hovering them while dragging a file. Dropping files onto a Data Connection
  item copies them to its data directory.
- datapackage.json files in data connections are now opened with the Spine datapackage form. This is a dedicated
  interface to prepare the datapackage for importing in the data store tree view.
- The data store tree view does not lock the database when there are uncommitted changes anymore.

  previous version, the first database in the list of saved references will be loaded for each Data Store.
- In the data store tree view, the object tree presents all relationship classes at the same level,
  regardless of how many object classes are involved. The same applies for relationships and objects.
