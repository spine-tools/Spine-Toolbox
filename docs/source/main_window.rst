Main Window

This section describes the different components in the application main window.

The first time you start the application you will see the main window like this.

The application main window contains four dock widgets (**Project**, **Properties**, **Event Log**, **Console**), a
**Toolbar**, a **Design View**, and a menu bar with **File**, **Edit**, **View**, **Plugins**, **Consoles**, **Server**
and **Help** menus. The **Project** dock widget contains a list of project items in the project. The **Properties**
dock widget shows the properties of the selected project item. **Event Log** shows messages based on user actions and
item executions. It shows messages from processes that are spawned by the application, i.e. it shows the stdout and
stderr streams of GAMS and executable programs. Also things like whether an item's execution was successful or not and
when the project or an item specification is saved are shown.

**Console** provides Julia and Python consoles that can be interacted with. What kind of console
is shown depends on the Tool type of the specific Tool. Only an item that is currently executing or has already
executed shows something in this dock widget. To view an item's console, the item must be selected. When executing
Python/Julia tools, the Tool's Python/Julia code will be included into the console and executed there.

.. tip:: You can configure the Julia and Python versions you want to use in **File -> Settings**.

The menu bar in the top of the application contains **File**, **Edit**, **View**, **Plugins**, **Consoles**, **Server**
and **Help** menus. In the **File** menu you can create a new project, open an existing project, save the project or
open the application Settings among other things. Spine Toolbox is project based, which means that you need to create
a new project or open an existing one before you can do anything. You can create a new project by selecting
**File -> New project...** from the menu bar. In the **Edit** menu you can for example copy, paste and duplicate items
as well as undo and redo actions. In the **Plugins** menu the user can install and manage plugins. **Consoles** menu
provides a way to start detached consoles. In the **Server** menu you can retrieve projects from a server. **Help**
contains a link to this documentation as well as other various information about Spine Toolbox.

The **Items** section of the **Toolbar** contains the available
:ref:`project item <Project Items>` types.
The **Execute** section contains icons that control the execution of the items in the **Design view** where you build your project.
The |play-all| button executes all Directed-Acyclic Graphs (DAG) in the project in a row. The |play-selected| button
executes the selected project items only. The |stop| button terminates the execution (if running).

You can add a new project item to your project by pointing your mouse cursor on any of the draggable items
in the **Toolbar**, then click-and-drag the item on to the **Design view**.
After this you will be presented a dialog, which asks you to fill in basic information about the new project
item (name, description, etc.).

The main window is very customizable so you can e.g. close the dock widgets that you do not need, rearrange the order
of the dock widgets by dragging them around and/or resize the views to fit your needs and display size or resolution. You can find more ways to
customize the visual elements of Spine Toolbox in the :ref:`settings <Settings>`.

.. note:: If you want to restore all dock widgets to their default place use the menu item
   **View -> Dock Widgets -> Restore Dock Widgets**.
   This will show all hidden dock widgets and restore them to the main window.

Below is an example on how you can customize the main window. In the picture, a user has created a project `New
Project` and created one project item from each of the eight categories. A Data Connection called `Data files`,
a Data Store called `Database`, a Data Transformer called `Data Transformer`, an Exporter called `Exporter`,
an Importer called `Importer`, a Merger called `Merger`, a Tool called `Julia model` and a View called `View`. The
project items are also listed in the **Project** dock widget. Some of the dock widgets have also been moved from
their original places.
