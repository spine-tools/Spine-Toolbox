*************************
How to set up SpineOpt.jl
*************************

#. Install Julia (v1.6 or later) from `<https://julialang.org/downloads/>`_ if you don't have one.
   See latest **SpineOpt.jl** Julia compatibility information `here <https://github.com/spine-tools/SpineOpt.jl#spineoptjl>`_.

#. Start Spine Toolbox

#. Create a new project (**File -> New project...**)

#. Select **File -> Settings** from the main menu and open the `Tools` page.

#. Set a path to a Julia executable to the appropriate line edit (e.g. ``C:/Julia-1.5.4/bin/julia.exe``).
   Your selections should look similar to this now.

#. *[Optional]* If you want to install and run SpineOpt in a specific Julia project environment (the place for
   ``Project.toml`` and ``Manifest.toml``), you can set the path to the environment folder to the line edit just below the
   Julia executable (the one that says `Using Julia default project`).

#. Next, you need to install **SpineOpt.jl** package for the Julia you just selected for Spine Toolbox. You can do
   this manually by `following the instructions <https://github.com/spine-tools/SpineOpt.jl#installation>`_
   **or** you can install **SpineOpt.jl** by clicking the **Add/Update SpineOpt** button. After clicking the button,
   an install/upgrade Spineopt wizard appears. Click **Next** twice and finally **Install SpineOpt**.
   **Wait until the process has finished** and you are greeted with this screen.

   Close the wizard.

#. Click **Ok** to close the **Settings** window
#. Back in the main window, select **Plugins -> Install pluginâ€¦** from the menu
#. Select `SpineOpt` and click **Ok**. After a short while, a red **SpineOpt Plugin Toolbar** will appear in the main
   window.

Spine Toolbox and Julia are now correctly set up for running **SpineOpt.jl**. Next step is to
`Create a project workflow using SpineOpt.jl <https://spine-tools.github.io/SpineOpt.jl/latest/getting_started/setup_workflow/>`_
(takes you to SpineOpt documentation). See also `Tutorials
<https://spine-tools.github.io/SpineOpt.jl/latest/tutorial/simple_system/>`_ in SpineOpt documentation for more advanced
use cases. For more information on how to select a specific Python or Julia version, see :ref:`Setting up External Tools`).

.. note:: The **SpineOpt Plugin Toolbar** contains an exporter specification as well as three predefined Tools that make
   use of SpineOpt.jl. **The SpineOpt Plugin is not a requirement to run SpineOpt.jl**, they are provided just for
   convenience and as examples to get you started quickly.
