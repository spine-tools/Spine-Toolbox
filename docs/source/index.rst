Welcome to Spine Toolbox's User Guide!
======================================
Spine Toolbox is an application, which provides means to define, manage, and execute complex data processing and
computation tasks, such as energy system models.

You can either start reading from the first page onwards or go straight to the :ref:`Getting Started` section to 
get you started quickly. If you need help understanding the terms we use throughout the app and this User Guide, 
please check the :ref:`Terminology` section. If you want to contribute to this project, please see the 
:ref:`Contribution Guide`. The last section contains the complete code reference of Spine Toolbox.
