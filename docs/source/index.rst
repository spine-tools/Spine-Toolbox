Welcome to Spine Toolbox's User Guide!
======================================
`Spine Toolbox <https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox>`_ is an application, which provides means to define, manage, and execute complex data processing and
computation tasks, such as energy system models.

If you are new to Spine Toolbox, :ref:`Getting Started` section is a good place to start. If you want to run

Gams for Spine Toolbox, see :ref:`Setting up External Tools`. Please see :ref:`Settings` chapter for information
on user customizable Spine Toolbox settings. If you need help in understanding the terms we use throughout the app
and this User Guide, please check the :ref:`Terminology` section. If you want to contribute to this project,
