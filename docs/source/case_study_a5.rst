Case Study A5 tutorial
**********************

Welcome to this Spine Toolbox Case Study tutorial.
Case Study A5 is one of the Spine Project case studies designed to verify
Toolbox and Model capabilities.
To this end, it *reproduces* an already existing study about hydropower
on the `Skellefte river <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skellefte_River>`_,
which models one week of operation of the fifteen power stations
along the river.

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to run Case Study A5 on Spine Toolbox
and is organized as follows:

Introduction
============

Model assumptions
-----------------
For each power station in the river, the following information is known:

- The capacity, or maximal electricity output. This datum also provides the maximal water discharge
  as per the efficiency curve (see next point).
- The efficiency curve, or conversion rate from water to electricity.
  In this study, a piece-wise linear efficiency with two segments is assumed.
  Moreover, this curve is monotonically decreasing, i.e., the efficiency in the first segment is strictly greater
  than the efficiency in the second segment.
- The maximal reservoir level (maximal amount of water that can be stored in the reservoir).
- The reservoir level at the beginning of the simulation period and at the end.
- The minimal amount of water that the plant must discharge at every hour.
  This is usually zero (except for one of the plants).
- The downstream plant, or next plant in the river course.
- The time that it takes for the water to reach the downstream plant.
  This time can be different depending on whether the water is discharged (goes through the turbine) or spilled.
- The local inflow, or amount of water that naturally enters the reservoir at every hour.
  In this study, it is assumed constant over the entire simulation period.
- The hourly average water discharge. It is assumed that before the beginning of the simulation,
  this amount of water has constantly been discharged at every hour.

The system is operated so as to maximize the total profit over the planning week,
while respecting capacity constraints, maximal reservoir level constrains, etc.
Hourly profit per plant is simply computed as the product of the electricity price and the production.




Modelling choices
-----------------

The model of the electric system is fairly simple, only two elements are needed:

- A common electricity node.
- A load unit that takes electricity from that node.

On the contrary, the model of the river system is more detailed.
Each power station in the river is modelled using the following elements:

- An upper water node, located at the entrance of the station.
- A lower water node, located at the exit of the station.
- A power plant unit, that discharges water from the upper node into the lower node,
  and feeds electricity produced in the process to the common electricity node.
- A spillway connection, that takes spilled water from the upper node and releases it to the downstream upper node.
- A discharge connection, that takes water from the lower node and releases it to the downstream upper node.

Below is a schematic of the model. For clarity, only the Rebnis station is presented in full detail:

   :scale: 50%


In order to run this tutorial you must first execute some preliminary steps from the 
`Simple System <./simple_system.html>`_
tutorial. Specifically, execute all steps from the `guide <./simple_system.html#guide>`_,
up to and including the step of `importing-the-spineopt-database-template <./simple_system.html#importing-the-spineopt-database-template>`_.
It is advisable to go through the whole tutorial in order to familiarise yourself with Spine.

.. note:: Just remember to give a different name for the Spine Project of the hydropower tutorial (e.g., ‘Case Study A5’) 
   in the corresponding step, so to not mix up the Spine Toolbox projects! 


Importing the SpineOpt database template
----------------------------------------

#. Download `the SpineOpt database template 
   <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spine-tools/SpineOpt.jl/master/templates/spineopt_template.json>`_
   (right click on the link, then select *Save link as...*)

#. Select the `input` Data Store item in the *Design View*.

#. Go to *Data Store Properties* and hit **Open editor**. This will open 
   the newly created database in the *Spine DB Editor*, looking similar to this:

   .. image:: img/case_study_a5_spine_db_editor_empty.png
      :align: center

   |

   .. note:: The *Spine DB editor* is a dedicated interface within Spine Toolbox
      for visualizing and managing Spine databases.

#. Press **Alt + F** to display the editor menu, select **File -> Import...**,
   and then select the template file you previously downloaded (in case it is not displayed in the folder where you saved it, double-check that you selected . 
   The contents of that file will be imported into the current database,
   and you should then see classes like ‘commodity’, ‘connection’ and ‘model’ under 
   the root node in the *Object tree* (on the left).

#. From the editor menu (Alt + F), select **Session -> Commit**.
   Enter ‘Import SpineOpt template’ as message in the popup dialog, and click **Commit**.


.. note:: The SpineOpt template contains the fundamental object and relationship classes,
   as well as parameter definitions, that SpineOpt recognizes and expects.
   You can think of it as the *generic structure* of the model,
   as opposed to the *specific data* for a particular instance.
   In the remainder of this section, we will add that specific data for the Skellefte river.

Entering data
=============

.. note::
   There are two options in this tutorial to enter data in the Database. The first one is to enter data manually
   and the second to :ref:`use the importer <importer>` functionality. These are described in the next two subsections 
   respectively and produce similar models. The model created when using the importer creates a model with two-segments
   efficiency curves for converting water to electricity (while the model created when entering the data manually
   assumes a simplified efficiency curve with a single segment).

Entering data manually
----------------------

Creating objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. To add power plants to the model, stay in the *Spine DB Editor* and create objects of class ``unit`` as follows:

   a. Select the list of plant names from the text-box below
      and copy it to the clipboard (**Ctrl+C**):

      ::

        Rebnis_pwr_plant
        Sadva_pwr_plant
        Bergnäs_pwr_plant
        Slagnäs_pwr_plant
        Bastusel_pwr_plant
        Grytfors_pwr_plant
        Gallejaur_pwr_plant
        Vargfors_pwr_plant
        Rengård_pwr_plant
        Båtfors_pwr_plant
        Finnfors_pwr_plant
        Granfors_pwr_plant
        Krångfors_pwr_plant
        Selsfors_pwr_plant
        Kvistforsen_pwr_plant

   b. Go to *Object tree* (on the top left of the window, usually),
      right-click on ``unit`` and select **Add objects** from the context menu. This will
      open the *Add objects* dialog.

   c. Select the first cell under the **object name** column
      and press **Ctrl+V**. This will paste the list of plant names from the clipboard into that column;
      the **object class name** column will be filled automatically with ‘unit‘.
      The form should now be looking similar to this:

        .. image:: img/add_power_plant_units.png
          :align: center

   d. Click **Ok**.
   e. Back in the *Spine DB Editor*, under *Object tree*, double click on ``unit``
      to confirm that the objects are effectively there.
   f. Commit changes with the message ‘Add power plants’.


#. Add discharge and spillway connections by creating objects of class ``connection``
   with the following names:
   ::

     Rebnis_to_Bergnäs_disch
     Sadva_to_Bergnäs_disch
     Bergnäs_to_Slagnäs_disch
     Slagnäs_to_Bastusel_disch
     Bastusel_to_Grytfors_disch
     Grytfors_to_Gallejaur_disch
     Gallejaur_to_Vargfors_disch
     Vargfors_to_Rengård_disch
     Rengård_to_Båtfors_disch
     Båtfors_to_Finnfors_disch
     Finnfors_to_Granfors_disch
     Granfors_to_Krångfors_disch
     Krångfors_to_Selsfors_disch
     Selsfors_to_Kvistforsen_disch
     Kvistforsen_to_downstream_disch
     Rebnis_to_Bergnäs_spill
     Sadva_to_Bergnäs_spill
     Bergnäs_to_Slagnäs_spill
     Slagnäs_to_Bastusel_spill
     Bastusel_to_Grytfors_spill
     Grytfors_to_Gallejaur_spill
     Gallejaur_to_Vargfors_spill
     Vargfors_to_Rengård_spill
     Rengård_to_Båtfors_spill
     Båtfors_to_Finnfors_spill
     Finnfors_to_Granfors_spill
     Granfors_to_Krångfors_spill
     Krångfors_to_Selsfors_spill
     Selsfors_to_Kvistforsen_spill
     Kvistforsen_to_downstream_spill

#. Add water nodes by creating objects of class ``node`` with the following names:

   ::

     Rebnis_upper
     Sadva_upper
     Bergnäs_upper
     Slagnäs_upper
     Bastusel_upper
     Grytfors_upper
     Gallejaur_upper
     Vargfors_upper
     Rengård_upper
     Båtfors_upper
     Finnfors_upper
     Granfors_upper
     Krångfors_upper
     Selsfors_upper
     Kvistforsen_upper
     Rebnis_lower
     Sadva_lower
     Bergnäs_lower
     Slagnäs_lower
     Bastusel_lower
     Grytfors_lower
     Gallejaur_lower
     Vargfors_lower
     Rengård_lower
     Båtfors_lower
     Finnfors_lower
     Granfors_lower
     Krångfors_lower
     Selsfors_lower
     Kvistforsen_lower

#. Next, create the following objects (all names in **lower-case**):

   a. ``instance`` of class ``model``.

   b. ``water`` and ``electricity`` of class ``commodity``.

   c. ``electricity_node`` of class ``node``.

   d. ``electricity_load`` of class ``unit``.

   e. ``some_week`` of class ``temporal_block``.

   f. ``deterministic`` of class ``stochastic_structure``.

   g. ``realization`` of class ``stochastic_scenario``.

#. Finally, create the following objects to get results back from Spine Opt
   (again, all names in **lower-case**):

   a. ``my_report`` of class ``report``.

   b. ``unit_flow``, ``connection_flow``, and ``node_state`` of class ``output``.


.. note:: To modify an object after you enter it, right click on it and select **Edit...** from the context menu.


.. _Specifying object parameter values:

Specifying object parameter values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


#. To specify the general behaviour of our model, stay in the *Spine DB Editor* and enter model parameter values as follows:

   a. Select the model parameter value data from the text-box below
      and copy it to the clipboard (**Ctrl+C**):

      .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-model-parameter-values.txt

   b. Select ``instance`` in the *Object tree* and inspect the table in *Object parameter value* (on the top-center of the window, usually).
      Make sure that the columns in the table are ordered as follows (drag and drop columns if you need to change their order):
      
      ::

         object_class_name | object_name | parameter_name | alternative_name | value | database

   c. Select the first cell under ``object_class_name`` and press **Ctrl+V**.
      This will paste the model parameter value data from the clipboard into the table.
      The form should be looking like this:

      .. image:: img/case_study_a5_model_parameters.png
            :align: center

#. Specify the resolution of our temporal block ``some_week`` in the same way using the data below:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-temporal_block-parameter-values.txt

#. Specify the behaviour of all system nodes with the data below, where:

   a. ``demand`` represents the local inflow (negative in most cases).
   b. ``fix_node_state`` represents fixed reservoir levels (at the beginning and the end).
   c. ``has_state`` indicates whether or not the node is a reservoir (true for all the upper nodes).
   d. ``state_coeff`` is the reservoir 'efficienty' (always 1, meaning that there aren't any loses).
   e. ``node_state_cap`` is the maximum level of the reservoirs.
   
   To do this in one single step, simply select ``node`` in the *Object tree* and paste the following values in the first empty cell:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-node-parameter-values.txt



Establishing relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip:: To enter the same text on several cells, copy the text into the clipboard, then select all
   target cells and press **Ctrl+V**.


#. Create relationships of the class ``unit__from_node`` to represent that a power plant receives water from 
   the station's upper water node, and that the electricity load takes electricity from the common
   electricity node. Both the power plants and the electricity load belong to the class ``unit``.

   a. Select the list of unit and node names from below
      and copy it to the clipboard (**Ctrl+C**).

      .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-unit__from_node.txt

   b. In the *Spine DB Editor*, go to *Relationship tree* (on the bottom left of the window, usually),
      right-click on ``unit__from_node``
      and select **Add relationships** from the context menu. This will
      open the *Add relationships* dialog.

   c. Select the first cell under the *unit* column
      and press **Ctrl+V**. This will paste the list of plant and node names from the clipboard into the table.
      The form should be looking like this:

      .. image:: img/add_pwr_plant_water_from_node.png
        :align: center

   d. Click **Ok**.
   e. Back in the *Spine DB Editor*, under *Relationship tree*, double click on
      ``unit__from_node`` to confirm that the relationships are effectively there.
   f. From the main menu (**Alt + F**), select **Session -> Commit** to open the *Commit changes* dialog.
      Enter ‘Add from nodes of power plants‘ as the commit message and click **Commit**.

#. Create relationships of the class ``unit__to_node`` to represent that a power plant releases water to the 
   station's lower water node, and that the power plants supply electricity to the common electricity node.
   Use the following data and do as before:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-unit__to_node.txt

   .. note:: At this point, you might be wondering what's the purpose of the ``unit__node__node``
      relationship class. Shouldn't it be enough to have ``unit__from_node`` and ``unit__to_node`` to represent
      the topology of the system? The answer is yes; but in addition to topology, we also need to represent
      the *conversion process* that happens in the unit, where the water from one node is turned into electricty
      for another node. And for this purpose, we use a relationship parameter value on the ``unit__node__node``
      relationships (see :ref:`Specifying relationship parameter values`).

#. Create relationships of the class ``connection__from_node`` to represent that water can be either discharged or spilled. If discharged, it is taken from the *lower* water node of the station, if spilled it is taken from the *upper* water node of the station. Use the following data and do as before:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-connection__from_node.txt

#. Create relationships of the class ``connection__to_node`` to represent that both discharge and spill are released into the *upper* node of the next downstream station. Use the following data and do as before:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-connection__to_node.txt

   .. note:: At this point, you might be wondering what's the purpose of the ``connection__node__node``
      relationship class. Shouldn't it be enough to have ``connection__from_node`` and ``connection__to_node``
      to represent the topology of the system? The answer is yes; but in addition to topology, we also need to represent
      the *delay* in the river branches.
      And for this purpose, we use a relationship parameter value on the ``connection__node__node``
      relationships (see :ref:`Specifying relationship parameter values`).


#. Create relationships of the class ``node__commodity`` to represent that each node has to be in balance, for water nodes with respect to water, for electricity nodes with respect to electricity. This way, you link all nodes to either the commocity ``water`` or the commodity ``electricity``. Use the following data and do as before:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-node__commodity.txt

#. Define that all nodes in our model have to be balanced at each time step. To do this, you create a relationship of the class ``model__default_temporal_block`` between the model ``instance`` and the temporal_block ``some_week`` in the same way as before.

#. Define that our model is deterministic. To do this, you create a relationship of the class ``model__default_stochastic_structure`` between the model ``instance`` and the stochastic structure ``deterministic``, as well as a relationship of class ``stochastic_structure__stochastic_scenario`` between the stochastid structure ``deterministic`` and the stochastic scenario ``realization`` in the same way as before.

#. In order to get the results from running Spine Opt written to the ouput database, create relationships of the class ``report__output`` between the report ``my_report`` and each of the following ``output`` objects: ``unit_flow``, ``connection_flow``, and ``node_state``. In addition, you also need to create a relationship of the class ``model__report`` between the model ``instance`` and the report ``my_report``.


.. _Specifying relationship parameter values:

Specifying parameter values of the relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


#. Finally, the values of all parameters have to be entered. Specify the capacity of all hydropower plants, 
   and their respective variable operating cost by entering ``unit__from_node`` parameter values as follows:

   a. Select the data from the text-box below
      and copy it to the clipboard (**Ctrl+C**):

      .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-unit__from_node-relationship-parameter-values.txt

   b. In the *Spine DB Editor*, go to *Relationship tree* (on the bottom left of the window, usually),
      and click on ``unit__from_node``. Then, go to *Relationship parameter value* (on the bottom-center of the window, usually).
      Make sure that the columns in the table are ordered as follows (drag and drop columns if you need to change their order):

      ::

         relationship_class_name | object_name_list | parameter_name | alternative_name | value | database

   c. Select the first cell under ``relationship_class_name`` and press **Ctrl+V**.
      This will paste the parameter value data from the clipboard into the table.


#. Specify the conversion ratio between discharged water and generated electricity for each hydropower station as well as a similar conversion rate (set to 1) to represent that water cannot be lost between upper and lower water nodes. Use the following data to enter the parameter values ``unit__from_node``:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-unit__node__node-relationship-parameter-values.txt


#. Specify the average discharge and spillage in the first hours of the simulation.
   Use the following data to enter the parameter values ``connection__from_node``:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-connection__from_node-relationship-parameter-values.txt


#. Finally, specify the delay (the time it takes for the water to run between water nodes) and the transfer ratio (being equal to 1) of different water connections.
   Use the following data to enter the parameter values ``connection__node_node``:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-connection__node__node-relationship-parameter-values.txt


#. When you're ready, commit all changes to the database via the main menu (**Alt + F**).



.. _importer:

Using the Importer
------------------

Additional Steps for Project Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Drag the Data Connection icon |dc_icon| from the tool bar and drop it into the
   Design View. This will open the *Add Data connection dialogue*. Type in ‘Data
   Connection’ and click on **Ok**.

#. To import the model into the Spine database, you need
   to create an *Import specification*. Create an *Import specification* by clicking
   on the small arrow next to the Importer item (in the Main section of the toolbar) and
   press **New**. The *Importer specification editor* will pop-up.

#. Type ‘Import Model’ as the name of the specification. Save the specification by 
   using **Ctrl+S** and close the window.
   
#. Drag the newly created Import Model Importer item icon |importer_icon| from the tool bar and
   drop it into the *Design View*. This will open the Add Importer dialogue. Type in
   ‘Import Model’ and click on **Ok**.

#. Connect ‘Data Connection’ with ‘Import Model’ by first clicking on one of the
   Data Connection’s connectors and then on one of the Importer’s connectors. Connect 
   similarly the importer with the input database. Now the project should look similar
   to this:

   .. image:: img/items_connections.png
      :align: center

#. From the main menu, select **File -> Save project**.

Importing the model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


#. Download `the data <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox/master/docs/source/data/a5.xlsx>`_ and `the
   accompanying mapping <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox/master/docs/source/data/A5_importer_specification.json>`_
   (right click on the links, then select *Save link as...*).

#. Add a reference to the file containing the model.

  #. Select the *Data Connection item* in the *Design View* to show the *Data
     Connection properties* window (on the right side of the window usually).
  #. In *Data Connection Properties*, click on , click on the icon furthest to the left **Add file references** 
     and select the previously downloaded Excel file.
  #. Next, double click on the *Import model* in the *Design view*. A window called *Select
     connector* for *Import Model* will pop-up, select Excel and klick **OK**. Next, still in
     the *Importer specification editor*, click on the main menu icon in the top right (or Press **Alt + F** to automatically display it) 
     and import the mappings previously downloaded (by clicking on **Import mappings**). Finally, save by clicking
     **Ctrl+S** and exit the *Importer specification editor*.

Executing the workflow
======================

Once the workflow is defined and input data is in place, the project is ready
to be executed. Hit the **Execute project** button |execute_project| on 
the tool bar.

You should see ‘Executing All Directed Acyclic Graphs’ printed in the *Event log*
(on the lower left by default).
SpineOpt output messages will appear in the *Process Log* panel in the middle.
After some processing, ‘DAG 1/1 completed successfully’ appears and the 
execution is complete.


Examining the results
=====================

Select the output data store and open the Spine DB editor.

.. image:: img/case_study_a5_output.png
   :align: center

To checkout the flow on the electricity load (i.e., the total electricity production in the system),
go to *Object tree*, expand the ``unit`` object class,
and select ``electricity_load``, as illustrated in the picture above.
Next, go to *Relationship parameter value* and double-click the first cell under `value`.
The *Parameter value editor* will pop up. You should see something like this:


.. image:: img/case_study_a5_output_electricity_load_unit_flow.png
   :align: center

.. note::
   If you have used the importer to instantiate the model you can easily modify the parameters in the **model** worksheet, 
   run the project and observe the differences in the results. If you need to make changes dirrectly to the input database,
   in order for the importer not to overwrite them, you will need to dissassociate the importer from the input DB
   (right click in the connecting yellow arrow between the two items and click on **remove**).
